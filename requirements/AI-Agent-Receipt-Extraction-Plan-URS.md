# AI Agent App: Development Planning & User Requirements Specification (URS)

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the development plan and user requirements for an AI-powered frontend application that scans payment receipts and extracts structured data. The app will be built using Next.js, integrate the Gemini API (free model), and leverage LangChain for AI agent functionality.

---

## 2. Development Planning

### Phase 1: MVP (Frontend Only)
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js, LangChain JS, Gemini API (Free Model), Browser Local Storage
- **Features:**
  - Upload payment receipt image
  - AI processing to extract relevant data from image
  - Display extracted data in a table
  - Store results in browser local storage

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Future)
- Backend integration (Node.js, database)
- User authentication
- History management
- Support for multiple AI models

### Milestones
| Milestone         | Description                                             | Timeline |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Project Setup     | Next.js scaffold, basic UI layout                      | Week 1   |
| AI Integration    | Connect Gemini API, LangChain pipeline                 | Week 2   |
| Receipt Upload    | Implement image upload & preview                       | Week 2   |
| Data Extraction   | AI extract product info from receipt                   | Week 3   |
| Data Display      | Render JSON results as a table                         | Week 3   |
| Local Storage     | Save/retrieve results from browser local storage       | Week 4   |
| Testing & QA      | Manual & automated tests                               | Week 4   |

## 3. User Requirements Specification (URS)

### 3.1 General Requirements
- The application must be a web-based frontend built with Next.js.
- The application must not require any backend (for MVP).
- AI integration must use Gemini API (free model) via LangChain.
- All data must be stored in browser local storage.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Image Upload & Receipt Scanning
- Users must be able to upload a payment receipt image (jpg, png, etc.).
- The app must provide a preview of the uploaded image.

#### 3.2.2 AI Data Extraction
- Upon receipt upload, the app must send the image to the Gemini API using LangChain.
- The AI must extract the following data:
  - Product name(s)
  - Product price(s)
  - Quantity for each product
  - Total price per product (`price * quantity`)
  - Total spending (sum of all products)

#### 3.2.3 Data Output and Display
- Extracted data must be structured as JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "products": [
      {
        "name": "Product A",
        "price": 10000,
        "quantity": 2,
        "total": 20000
      },
      ...
    ],
    "total_spending": 35000
  }
  ```
- The data must be displayed as a table in the UI, showing all products and totals.

#### 3.2.4 Local Storage
- The result data (JSON) must be saved in browser local storage.
- Users must be able to view previous extraction results from local storage.

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements
- The app must be responsive and work on desktop and mobile browsers.
- User experience must be simple, fast, and intuitive.
- All processing must be client-side except AI inference (which uses Gemini API).
- Privacy: Uploaded images and extracted data must not be sent to any server except the AI API.

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- User can upload a payment receipt image.
- AI reliably extracts required fields and displays them in a table.
- Extracted data is stored and retrievable from local storage.
- UI is clear and easy to use.
- No backend server involved in MVP.

---

## 5. Risks & Considerations

- Gemini API free model rate limits and accuracy
- Image quality and OCR reliability
- Browser local storage limitations
- LangChain integration compatibility

### Example Table UI

| Product Name | Price   | Quantity | Total   |
|--------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Product A    | 10000   | 2        | 20000   |
| Product B    | 15000   | 1        | 15000   |
| **Total Spending** |         |          | 35000   |
